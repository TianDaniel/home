	                    This past season, the Spurs have relied on a 3-4-2-1 formation when playing.
	                    Such formation includes 3 center backs, 2 wing-backs, 2 center-defensive midfielders,
	                    2 wingers and a striker. This non-traditional formation relies on the wing-backs going
	                    up and down the pitch and wingers tucking in as forwards. This formation allows for great
	                    attacking play but lacks defense with Tottenham's wing-backs being more attacking oriented.

	                    With their newly appointed coach Ange Postecoglou, the team plans to switch their formation into a 
	                    4-3-3 with inverted fullbacks, another unique formation that coach has perfected with his old team Celtic
	                    FC. It will take time for the players to get use to a new playstyle next season but it will hopefully lead
	                    to sucess.
